- I performed the exploratory test and UAT Test using TestFlight and log in with user id.
- I focused on the customer page, explore and testing on adding new customer with valid and invalid customer.
- I found the bug and report the actioned performed, expected and actual result to the project lead.
- I also studied on the other testers projects how their test passing and rejecting to understand on testing on and outside the scope.
